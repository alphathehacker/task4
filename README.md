# 🏠 House Price Prediction – Task 4 (Main Flow Internship)

This repository contains the implementation of **Task 4: Regression Analysis** from the **Data Analysis and Data Science with Python Internship** at **Main Flow Services and Technologies Pvt. Ltd.**

## 📌 Objective
To build a **linear regression model** that predicts house prices based on:
- Size (in square feet)
- Number of Rooms
- Location (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

## 📁 Files Included
- `house_prices_large.csv` – Sample dataset used
- `House_Price_Regression_Task4.ipynb` – Complete Jupyter notebook with code and step-by-step explanation

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder, LinearRegression)

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling
- Training & evaluating regression models
- Visualizing results and extracting insights

## 📊 Model Evaluation
- **RMSE**: Measures average prediction error  
- **R² Score**: Explains how well the model fits the data  

## ✅ Output
A working regression model that predicts house prices and highlights important influencing features.
